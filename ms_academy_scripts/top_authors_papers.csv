These systems, especially the k-nearest neighbor collaborative ltering based ones, are achieving widespread success on the Web. The tremendous growth in the amount of available information and the number of visitors to Web sites in recent years poses some key challenges for recommender systems. These are: producing high quality recommendations, performing many recommendations per second for millions of users and items and achieving high coverage in the face of data sparsity. In traditional collaborative ltering systems the amount of work increases with the number of participants in the system. New recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations, even for very large-scale problems. To address these issues we have explored item-based collaborative ltering techniques. Item-based techniques rst analyze the user-item matrix to identify relationships between di erent items, and then use these relationships to indirectly compute recommendations for users. In this paper we analyze di erent item-based recommendation generation algorithms. We look into di erent techniques for computing item-item similarities (e.g., item-item correlation vs. cosine similarities between item vectors) and di erent techniques for obtaining recommendations from them (e.g., weighted sum vs. regression model). Finally, we experimentally evaluate our results and compare them to the basic k-nearest neighbor approach. Our experiments suggest that item-based algorithms provide dramatically better performance than user-based algorithms, while at the same time providing better quality than the best available userbased algorithms.",http://files.grouplens.org/papers/www10_sarwar.pdf

In addition to reviewing the evaluation strategies used by prior researchers, we present empirical results from the analysis of various accuracy metrics on one content domain where all the tested metrics collapsed roughly into three equivalence classes.

The rating servers predict scores based on the heuristic that people who agreed in the past will probably agree again. Users can protect their privacy by entering ratings under pseudonyms, without reducing the effectiveness of the score prediction.

Readers of technical groups, such as comp.lang.c11 value articles based on interest and usefulness to them—introductory questions and answers may be uninteresting to an expert C11 programmer just as debates over subtle and advanced language features may be useless to the novice. The combination of high volume and personal taste made Usenet news a promising candidate for collaborative filtering. More formally, we determined the potential predictive utility for Usenet news was very high.

These systems are achieving widespread success in E-commerce nowadays, especially with the advent of the Internet. The tremendous growth of customers and products poses three key challenges for recommender systems in the E-commerce domain. These are: producing high quality recommendations, performing many recommendations per second for millions of customers and products, and achieving high coverage in the face of data sparsity. One successful recommender system technology is collaborative filtering, which works by matching customer preferences to other customers in making recommendations. Collaborative filtering has been shown to produce high quality recommendations, but the performance degrades with the number of customers and products. New recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations, even for very largescale problems. This paper presents two different experiments where we have explored one technology called Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce the dimensionality of recommender system databases. Each experiment compares the quality of a recommender system using SVD with the quality of a recommender system using collaborative filtering. The first experiment compares the effectiveness of the two recommender systems at predicting consumer preferences based on a database of explicit ratings of products. The second experiment compares the effectiveness of the two recommender systems at producing Top-N lists based on a real-life customer purchase database from an E-Commerce site. Our experience suggests that SVD has the potential to meet many of the challenges of recommender systems, under certain conditions.",http://ai.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/WEBKDD2000/papers/sarwar.pdf

Explanations provide that transparency, exposing the reasoning and data behind a recommendation.

They represent a powerful method for enabling users to filter through large information and product spaces. Nearly two decades of research on collaborative filtering have led to a varied set of algorithms and a rich collection of tools for evaluating their performance. Research in the field is moving in the direction of a richer understanding of how recommender technology may be embedded in specific domains. The differing personalities exhibited by different recommender algorithms show that recommendation is not a one-size-fits-all problem. Specific tasks, information needs, and item domains represent unique problems for recommenders, and design and evaluation of recommenders needs to be done based on the user tasks to be supported. Effective deployments must begin with careful analysis of prospective users and their goals. Based on this analysis, system designers have a host of options for the choice of algorithm and for its embedding in the surrounding user experience. This paper discusses a~wide variety of the choices available and their implications, aiming to provide both practicioners and researchers with an introduction to the important issues underlying recommenders and current best practices for addressing these issues.",http://nowpublishers.com/article/DownloadSummary/HCI-009

Information filtering (IF) focuses on the analysis of item content and the development of a personal user interest profile. Collaborative filtering (CF) focuses on identification of other users with similar tastes and the use of their opinions to recommend items. Each technique has advantages and limitations that suggest that the two could be beneficially combined.This paper shows that a CF framework can be used to combine personal IF agents and the opinions of a community of users to produce better recommendations than either agents or users can produce alone. It also shows that using CF to create a personal combination of a set of agents produces better results than either individual agents or other combination mechanisms. One key implication of these results is that users can avoid having to select among agents; they can use them all and let the CF framework select the best ones for them.,http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/aaai/aaai99.html#GoodSKBSHR99

This paper defines and implements a model for integrating content-based ratings into a collaborative filtering system. The filterbot model allows collaborative filtering systems to address sparsity by tapping the strength of content filtering techniques.

One application in which they have become particularly common is in e-commerce, where recommendation of items can often help a customer find what she is interested in and, therefore can help drive sales. Unscrupulous producers in the never-ending quest for market penetration may find it profitable to shill recommender systems by lying to the systems in order to have their products recommended more often than those of their competitors. This paper explores four open questions that may affect the effectiveness of such shilling attacks: which recommender algorithm is being used, whether the application is producing recommendations or predictions, how detectable the attacks are by the operator of the system, and what the properties are of the items being attacked. The questions are explored experimentally on a large data set of movie ratings. Taken together, the results of the paper suggest that new ways must be used to evaluate and detect shilling attacks on recommender systems.",http://www.ra.ethz.ch/cdstore/www2004/docs/1p393.pdf

In this paper we study six techniques that collaborative filtering recommender systems can use to learn about new users. These techniques select a sequence of items for the collaborative filtering system to present to each new user for rating. The techniques include the use of information theory to select the items that will give the most value to the recommender system, aggregate statistics to select the items the user is most likely to have an opinion about, balanced techniques that seek to maximize the expected number of bits learned per presented item, and personalized techniques that predict which items a user will have an opinion about.

Instead of performing content indexing or content analysis, collaborative filtering systems rely entirely on interest ratings from members of a participating community. Since predictions are based on human ratings, collaborative filtering systems have the potential to provide filtering based on complex attributes, such as quality, taste, or aesthetics. Many implementations of collaborative filtering apply some variation of the neighborhood-based prediction algorithm. Many variations of similarity metrics, weighting approaches, combination measures, and rating normalization have appeared in each implementation. For these parameters and others, there is no consensus as to which choice of technique is most appropriate for what situations, nor how significant an effect on accuracy each parameter has. Consequently, every person implementing a collaborative filtering system must make hard design choices with little guidance. This article provides a set of recommendations to guide design of neighborhood-based prediction systems, based on the results of an empirical study. We apply an analysis framework that divides the neighborhood-based prediction approach into three components and then examines variants of the key parameters in each component.

The psychological literature on conformity suggests that in the course of helping people make choices, these systems probably affect users' opinions of the items. If opinions are influenced by recommendations, they might be less valuable for making recommendations for other users. Further, manipulators who seek to make the system generate artificially high or low recommendations might benefit if their efforts influence users to change the opinions they contribute to the recommender. We study two aspects of recommender system interfaces that may affect users' opinions: the rating scale and the display of predictions at the time users rate items.

A new user preference elicitation strategy needs to ensure that the user does not a) abandon a lengthy signup process, and b) lose interest in returning to the site due to the low quality of initial recommendations. We extend the work of [23] in this paper by incrementally developing a set of information theoretic strategies for the new user problem. We propose an offline simulation framework, and evaluate the strategies through extensive offline simulations and an online experiment with real users of a live recommender system.",http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/fetch/papers/rashidWebKDD08.pdf

We explore several methods for augmenting existing collaborative and content-based filtering algorithms with measures of the influence of a paper within the web of citations. We measure influence using well-known algorithms, such as HITS and PageRank, for measuring a node's importance in a graph. Among these augmentation methods is a novel method for using importance scores to influence collaborative filtering.

In this paper, we address such systems and introduce a new class of recommender system called meta-recommenders.

These systems are achieving widespread success in e-commerce nowadays. The tremendous growth of customers and products poses some key challenges for collaborative filtering (CF) based recommender systems. These axe: producing high quality recommendations, performing many recommendations per second for millions of customers and products, achieving high coverage in presence of data sparsity, and meeting the demands of widespread availability. New recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations, even for very large-scale problems. 
In this dissertation, we present our approaches to address three such research challenges—sparsity, scalability, and distribution. For the first two challenges, we perform experiments on real-world data. Our experiments show improvements over the basic CF-based algorithm. For the third challenge, we provide a framework that can be extended to implement distributed recommender systems. 
We tackle the sparsity problem in two ways—by implementing a model for integrating content-based ratings into a CF system and by applying alternate algorithmic approaches to address sparsity. For the first approach, we apply semi-intelligent filtering agents that generate ratings by analyzing syntactic features of the item content. For the second approach, we apply singular value decomposition (SVD) based prediction algorithms and item-based CF algorithms. Our results suggest that both of these techniques are capable of addressing the sparsity issue. 
We apply two different approaches to address the scalability issue—by using dimensionality reduction for neighborhood formation and by using incremental model-based techniques. In the first approach, we use SVD based dimensionality reduction technique and a clustering based technique. In the second approach, we use SVD-based incremental technique, incremental item-based technique, and association rule-based technique. Our results suggest that these methods have potential for improving the scalability of recommender systems. 
We address the distribution issue by analyzing different approaches to implement distributed CF-based recommender systems. We present a taxonomy of recommender system applications based on the relative relevance of geographically proximate and distant users and items.

Recommender systems apply KDD-like techniques to the problem of making product recommendations during a live customer interaction. These systems are achieving widespread success in E-Commerce today.

Recommender systems face three key challenges: producing high quality recommendations, performing many recommendations per second for millions of customers and products, and achieving high coverage in the face of data sparsity. One successful recommender system technology is collaborative filtering, which works by matching customer preferences to other customers in making recommendations. Collaborative filtering has been shown to produce high quality recommendations, but the performance degrades with the number of customers and products. New recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations, even for very large-scale problems. For example, traditional KDD techniques might be applied in the context of our model to address these challenges. We have explored one technology called Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce the dimensionality of recommender system problems. We report an experiment where we use SVD on a recommender system database, and use the relationship between customers in the reduced factor space to generate predictions for products.

If properly analyzed, this data could be a source of rich intelligence for providing real-time decision making and for the provision of travel tour recommendations. However, tour recommendation is quite different from traditional recommendations, because the tourist’s choice is affected directly by the travel costs, which includes both financial and time costs. To that end, in this article, we provide a focused study of cost-aware tour recommendation. Along this line, we first propose two ways to represent user cost preference. One way is to represent user cost preference by a two-dimensional vector. Another way is to consider the uncertainty about the cost that a user can afford and introduce a Gaussian prior to model user cost preference. With these two ways of representing user cost preference, we develop different cost-aware latent factor models by incorporating the cost information into the probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) model, the logistic probabilistic matrix factorization (LPMF) model, and the maximum margin matrix factorization (MMMF) model, respectively. When applied to real-world travel tour data, all the cost-aware recommendation models consistently outperform existing latent factor models with a significant margin.",http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~qiliuql/files/Publications/YongGe-TOIS2013.pdf

For a statistical model-based CF approach, we formally showed that this additional aggregated information provides more accurate recommendations of individual items to individual users. Furthermore, theoretical insights gained from the analysis of this model-based method suggested a way to incorporate aggregate information into the heuristic item-based CF method. Both the model-based and the heuristic item-based CF methods were empirically tested on several datasets, and the experiments uniformly confirmed that the aggregate rating information indeed improves CF recommendations. These results also show the power of theory by demonstrating how the insights gained from theoretical developments can shed light on proper selection of good heuristic methods.

For example, the well-known Netflix Movie rating data contain ratings of only about 1% user-item pairs. One way to address this rating sparsity problem is to develop more effective methods for training rating prediction models. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a collective training paradigm to automatically and effectively augment the training ratings. Essentially, the collective training paradigm builds multiple different Collaborative Filtering (CF) models separately, and augments the training ratings of each CF model by using the partial predictions of other CF models for unknown ratings. Along this line, we develop two algorithms, Bi-CF and Tri-CF, based on collective training. For Bi-CF and Tri-CF, we collectively and iteratively train two and three different CF models via iteratively augmenting training ratings for individual CF model. We also design different criteria to guide the selection of augmented training ratings for Bi-CF and Tri-CF. Finally, the experimental results show that Bi-CF and Tri-CF algorithms can significantly outperform baseline methods, such as neighborhood-based and SVD-based models.",http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~qiliuql/files/Publications/RecSys2011.pdf

However, a large fraction of users has no prior inter-actions, making it impossible to use collaborative filtering or rely on user history for personalization. Even the most active users mayvisit only a few times a year and may have volatile needs or different personas, making their personal history a sparse and noisy signal at best. This paper investigates how, when we cannot rely on the user history, the large scale availability of other user interactions still allows us to build meaningful profiles from the contextual data and whether such contextual profiles are useful to customize the ranking, exemplified by data from a major online travel agentBooking.com.Our main findings are threefold: First, we characterize the Continuous Cold Start Problem(CoCoS) from the viewpoint of typical e-commerce applications. Second, as explicit situational con-text is not available in typical real world applications, implicit cues from transaction logs used at scale can capture essential features of situational context. Third, contextual user profiles can be created offline, resulting in a set of smaller models compared to a single huge non-contextual model, making contextual ranking available with negligible CPU and memory footprint. Finally we conclude that, in an online A/B test on live users, our contextual ranker in-creased user engagement substantially over a non-contextual base-line, with click-through-rate (CTR) increased by 20%. This clearly demonstrates the value of contextual user profiles in a real world application.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.07904v1

In an ACF system, users indicate their preferences by rating their level of interest in items that the system presents. The ACF system uses the ratings information to match together users with similar interests. Finally, the ACF system can predict a user's rating for an unseen item by examining his neighbors' ratings for that item. 
This dissertation presents a set of results with the goal of improving the effectiveness and understanding of ACF systems. The results cover four challenges: understanding and standardizing evaluation of ACF systems, improving the accuracy of ACF systems, designing and utilizing effective explanations for ACF predictions, and improving ACF to support ephemeral recommendations. To address these challenges, a combination of offline analysis and user testing is used. 
All of the evaluation metrics that have been proposed for ACF are examined theoretically and compared empirically. The empirical results show that all proposed ACF evaluation metrics perform similarly, which argues for the adoption of a standardized evaluation metric—for which I propose mean absolute error. 
With respect to improving algorithm accuracy, I present a detailed empirical examination of the neighborhood-based prediction algorithm, which has been the most successful algorithm, both in research and in commercial applications. 
ACF systems predict based on data of variable quantity and quality, but current ACF systems are black boxes, so users have no indication of when to trust an ACF prediction. Explanations expose some of the process and data behind the ACF prediction, allowing users to judge if a prediction is appropriate for their current context of risk. I present results showing what forms of explanation users find the most compelling, as well as indications that explanations can increase the acceptance of ACF systems. 
Finally, I present results from tests of a new algorithm for supporting focused ephemeral user information needs. Ephemeral information needs are those needs that are immediate, focused, and often temporary. The proposed algorithm provides support for ephemeral information needs using no additional data beyond the standard ACF ratings.",https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=932346

Collaborative filtering is one technique among many information filtering techniques that range from unfiltered to personalized and from effortless to laborious. Libraries or the Web are good examples of unfiltered information sources. E-mail directed to one recipient is a good example of a filtered information source. A best-seller list requires little effort fur the user, but provides the same recommendations to all users. Filters based on demographics, such as age, sex, or marital status, require some effort from the user in providing the demographics, and provide some level of personal filtering, so they are near the middle of the chart. Collaborative filtering requires relatively little effort from the user, and provides individually targeted recommendations, so it is in the upper right of the chart. Effort, of course, can be reduced via automation. While collaborative filtering is not necessarily effortless, it requires a relatively small amount of effort on the part of the user and provides very individualized recommendations.

Stability is defined to measure the extent to which a recommendation algorithm provides predictions that are consistent with each other. Specifically, for a stable algorithm, adding some of the algorithm’s own predictions to the algorithm’s training data (for example, if these predictions were confirmed as accurate by users) would not invalidate or change the other predictions. While stability is an interesting theoretical property that can provide additional understanding about recommendation algorithms, we believe stability to be a desired practical property for recommender systems designers as well, because unstable recommendations can potentially decrease users’ trust in recommender systems and, as a result, reduce users’ acceptance of recommendations. In this article, we also provide an extensive empirical evaluation of stability for six popular recommendation algorithms on four real-world datasets. Our results suggest that stability performance of individual recommendation algorithms is consistent across a variety of datasets and settings. In particular, we find that model-based recommendation algorithms consistently demonstrate higher stability than neighborhood-based collaborative filtering techniques.

Stability is a desired property of recommendation algorithms and has important implications on users’ trust and acceptance of recommendations. Prior research has reported that some popular recommendation algorithms can suffer from a high degree of instability. In this study, we explore two scalable, general-purpose meta-algorithmic approaches—based on bagging and iterative smoothing—that can be used in conjunction with different traditional recommendation algorithms to improve their stability. Our experimental results on real-world rating data demonstrate that both approaches can achieve substantially higher stability as compared to the original recommendation algorithms. Furthermore, perhaps as importantly, the proposed approaches not only do not sacrifice the predictive accuracy in order to improve recommendation stability, but are actually able to provide additional accuracy improvements.",http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tkde/tkde27.html#AdomaviciusZ15

Recommender systems research typically explores and develops techniques and applications for recommending various products or services to individual users based on the knowledge of users’ tastes and preferences as well as users’ past activities (such as previous purchases), which are applicable in a variety of domains and settings (Jannach et al. 2010). While a substantial amount of research has already been performed in the area of recommender systems, many existing approaches have focused on recommending the most relevant items to users and do not take into account any additional contextual information, such as time, location, weather, the user’s current goals, the user’s mood, presence of other people, or the type of the device through which the recommendation is consumed. In other words, traditionally recommender systems deal with applications having only two types of entities, users and items, and do not put them into a context when providing recommendations.

Collaborative filtering and, more generally, recommender systems represent an increasingly popular and important set of personalization technologies that help people navigate through the vast amounts of information. The performance of recommender systems can be evaluated along several dimensions, such as the accuracy of recommendations for each user and the diversity of recommendations across different users. Intuitively, there is a tradeoff between accuracy and diversity, because high accuracy may often be obtained by safely recommending to users the most popular (“bestselling”) items, which can lead to the reduction in recommendation diversity, i.e., less personalized recommendations. And conversely, higher diversity can be achieved by trying to uncover and recommend highly idiosyncratic/personalized items for each user, which are inherently more difficult to predict and, thus, may lead to a decrease in recommendation accuracy. In our research we explore different ways to overcome this accuracy-diversity tradeoff, and in this paper we discuss a variance-based approach that can improve both the accuracy and diversity of recommendations obtained from a traditional collaborative filtering technique. We provide empirical results based on several real-world movie rating datasets.",http://ids.csom.umn.edu/faculty/gedas/NSFCareer/RS-WITS-2008-wp.pdf

There are many networks available with more than 100 million registered users such as Facebook, MySpace, QZone, Windows Live Spaces etc. People may connect, discover and share by using these online social networks. The exponential growth of online communities in the area of social networks attracts the attention of the researchers about the importance of managing trust in online environment. Users of the online social networks may share their experiences and opinions within the networks about an item which may be a product or service. The user faces the problem of evaluating trust in a service or service provider before making a choice. Recommendations may be received through a chain of friends network, so the problem for the user is to be able to evaluate various types of trust opinions and recommendations. This opinion or recommendation has a great influence to choose to use or enjoy the item by the other user of the community. Collaborative filtering system is the most popular method in recommender system. The task in collaborative filtering is to predict the utility of items to a particular user based on a database of user rates from a sample or population of other users. Because of the different taste of different people, they rate differently according to their subjective taste. If two people rate a set of items similarly, they share similar tastes. In the recommender system, this information is used to recommend items that one participant likes, to other persons in the same cluster. But the collaborative filtering system performs poor when there is insufficient previous common rating available between users; commonly known as cost start problem. To overcome the cold start problem and with the dramatic growth of online social networks, trust based approach to recommendation has emerged. This approach assumes a trust network among users and makes recommendations based on the ratings of the users that are directly or indirectly trusted by the target user.",https://core.ac.uk/display/10903601

Previous work in educational data mining has explored matrix factorization techniques for grade prediction, albeit without taking contextual information into account. Temporal information should be informative as it distinguishes between the different class offerings and indirectly captures student experience as well. To exploit temporal and/or other kinds of context, we develop three approaches under the framework of collaborative filtering (CF).

The third utilizes tensor factorization to model grades and their context, without introducing a new mode per context dimension as is common in the CF literature. The latent factors obtained can be used to predict grades   and   context, if desired. We evaluate these approaches on grade data obtained from the University of Minnesota.

Although such approaches have been shown to lead to good results, the aspects that are important to different users can vary. In many domains, there may be a set of aspects for which all users care about and a set of aspects that are specific to different subsets of users. To explicitly capture this, we consider models in which there are some latent factors that capture the shared aspects and some user subset specific latent factors that capture the set of aspects that the different subsets of users care about.     In particular, we propose two latent space models: rGLSVD and sGLSVD, that combine such a global and user subset specific sets of latent factors. The rGLSVD model assigns the users into different subsets based on their rating patterns and then estimates a global and a set of user subset specific local models whose number of latent dimensions can vary.     The sGLSVD model estimates both global and user subset specific local models by keeping the number of latent dimensions the same among these models but optimizes the grouping of the users in order to achieve the best approximation.

An additional source of preference information is to use the ratings that users provide on sets of items. The advantages of using preferences on sets are twofold. First, a rating provided on a set conveys some preference information about each of the set’s items, which allows us to acquire a user’s preferences for more items than the number of ratings that the user provided. Second, due to privacy concerns, users may not be willing to reveal their preferences on individual items explicitly but may be willing to provide a single rating to a set of items, since it provides some level of information hiding. This article investigates two questions related to using set-level ratings in recommender systems. First, how users’ item-level ratings relate to their set-level ratings. Second, how collaborative filtering-based models for item-level rating prediction can take advantage of such set-level ratings. We have collected set-level ratings from active users of Movielens on sets of movies that they have rated in the past. Our analysis of these ratings shows that though the majority of the users provide the average of the ratings on a set’s constituent items as the rating on the set, there exists a significant number of users that tend to consistently either under- or over-rate the sets. We have developed collaborative filtering-based methods to explicitly model these user behaviors that can be used to recommend items to users. Experiments on real data and on synthetic data that resembles the under- or over-rating behavior in the real data demonstrate that these models can recover the overall characteristics of the underlying data and predict the user’s ratings on individual items.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12643v1

This is usually referred to as a top-N recommendation task, where the goal of the recommender system is to find a few specific items which are supposed to be most appealing to the user. Common methodologies based on error metrics (such as RMSE) are not a natural fit for evaluating the top-N recommendation task. Rather, top-N performance can be directly measured by alternative methodologies based on accuracy metrics (such as precision/recall).     An extensive evaluation of several state-of-the art recommender algorithms suggests that algorithms optimized for minimizing RMSE do not necessarily perform as expected in terms of top-N recommendation task. Results show that improvements in RMSE often do not translate into accuracy improvements. In particular, a naive non-personalized algorithm can outperform some common recommendation approaches and almost match the accuracy of sophisticated algorithms. Another finding is that the very few top popular items can skew the top-N performance. The analysis points out that when evaluating a recommender algorithm on the top-N recommendation task, the test set should be chosen carefully in order to not bias accuracy metrics towards non-personalized solutions. Finally, we offer practitioners new variants of two collaborative filtering algorithms that, regardless of their RMSE, significantly outperform other recommender algorithms in pursuing the top-N recommendation task, with offering additional practical advantages.

This way, we do not need to interpret each user feedback value as a number, but only rely on the more relaxed assumption of having an order among the different feedback ratings. Such an ordinal view frequently provides a more natural reflection of the user intention when providing qualitative ratings, allowing users to have different internal scoring scales. Moreover, we can address scenarios where assigning numerical scores to different types of user feedback would not be easy. Our approach is based on a pointwise ordinal model, which allows it to linearly scale with data size. The framework can wrap most collaborative filtering algorithms, upgrading those algorithms designed to handle numerical values into being able to handle ordinal values. In particular, we demonstrate our framework with wrapping a leading matrix factorization CF method. A cornerstone of our method is its ability to predict a full probability distribution of the expected item ratings, rather than only a single score for an item. One of the advantages this brings is a novel approach to estimating the confidence level in each individual prediction.

However, in reality many systems deal with item-oriented recommendations. In such setups, given a single item of interest, the system needs to provide other related items, following patterns like ""people who liked this also liked..."".     While item-oriented systems are central in their importance, they have been approached so far using very basic tools. We identify several hurdles faced by standard approaches to the item-oriented task. First, the sparseness of observed activities prevents establishing reliable similarity relations for many item pairs. Second, we address a scalability challenge at the retrieval stage present in many real-world systems: Given an item inventory, which may encompass millions of items, it is desired to identify the most related item pairs in a sub-quadratic time. This work addresses these two challenges, thereby improving both accuracy and scalability of item-oriented recommenders. Additionally, we propose an empirical evaluation scheme for comparing the quality of different solutions with encouraging results.",http://www.noamko.org/papers/item_based_recsys_2013.pdf

Such an ordinal view frequently provides a more natural reflection of the user intention when providing qualitative ratings, allowing users to have different internal scoring scales. Moreover, we can address scenarios where assigning numerical scores to different types of user feedback would not be easy. The framework can wrap most collaborative filtering algorithms, enabling algorithms previously designed for numerical values to handle ordinal values. We demonstrate our framework by wrapping a leading matrix factorization CF method. A cornerstone of our method is its ability to predict a full probability distribution of the expected item ratings, rather than only a single score for an item. One of the advantages this brings is a novel approach to estimating the confidence level in each individual prediction. Compared to previous approaches to confidence estimation, ours is more principled and empirically superior in its accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach on two of the largest publicly available datasets: the Netflix data and the Yahoo! Music data.",http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ijcai/ijcai2013.html#KorenS13

This work develops a recommender system aiming to present users with items -- news stories, in our case -- on which they are likely to comment. We combine items' content with a collaborative-filtering approach (utilizing users' co-commenting patterns) in a latent factor modeling framework. Building upon previous work, we focus on a continuous, real-time approach to address the problem above. After an initial training period during which commenting activity of users is observed, the system is tested at each subsequent comment submission event by predicting which story is being commented on by a given user at a given time. Our results show that we are able to overcome the site's inherent presentation bias and outperform a strong baseline as users' commenting history grows.",https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2365996

The disclosed system learns a belief network using both prior knowledge obtained from an expert in a given field of decision making and a database containing empirical data obtained from many people. The empirical data contains attributes of users as well as their preferences in the field of decision making. After initially learning the belief network, the belief network is relearned at various intervals when additional attributes are identified as having a causal effect on the preferences and data for these additional attributes can be gathered. This relearning allows the belief network to improve its accuracy at predicting preferences of a user. Upon each iteration of relearning, a cluster model is automatically generated that best predicts the data in the database. After relearning the belief network a number of times, the belief network is used to predict the preferences of a user using probabilistic inference. In performing probabilistic inference, the known attributes of a user are received and the belief network is accessed to determine the probability of the unknown preferences of the user given the known attributes. Based on these probabilities, the preference most likely to be desired by the user can be predicted.",https://lens.org/099-153-212-118-617

By discounting the ranking, or adjusting ranking values generated by a known search engine as a function of the knowledge probability estimates, the present invention reduces or eliminates the risk of locating known information near the top of a list of search results. This is advantageous since known information is generally of little interest to a user. In various embodiments the popularity of an item is used to estimate the probability that the item is already known to a user. In addition, in various embodiments one or more user controllable parameters are used in the generation of the knowledge probability estimates and/or the ranking of the search results to give the user an opportunity to have the ranking of the search results accurately reflect the user's knowledge. The present invention is particularly well suited to collaborative filtering based search systems. This is because collaborative filters make recommendations to a user based on historical information relating to, e.g., the popularity of items being considered for recommendation.

We evaluate our method using book recommendation data, including offline analysis on 361,349 ratings and an online study involving more than 2,100 subjects.",https://content.iospress.com/articles/ai-communications/aic430

We show how such attributes can be modeled as a preference vector that can be used in a vector-space content-based recommender, and how that content-based recommender can be integrated with various collaborative filtering techniques through re-weighting of Top-M recommendations. We evaluate this approach on several recommender systems datasets and collaborative filtering methods, and find that incorporating the three preference attributes can lead to a substantial increase in Top-50 precision while also enhancing diversity and novelty.",http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/recsys/recsys2013.html#MouraoRKM13

Don’t believe that? Here is some evidence: The world’s total yearly production of print, film, optical, and magnetic content would require roughly 1.5 billion gigabytes of storage. This is the equivalent of 250 megabytes per person for each man, woman, and child on earth. (Lyman and Varian, 2000) The massive amount of content produced each day is changing the way each of us lives our life. Historically, society has coped with the problem of too much information by employing editors, reviewers, and publishers to separate the signal from the noise. The problem is that we do not have enough editors, publishers, and reviewers to keep up with the volume of new content. One solution to this problem is to use technology to allow each of us to act as an editor, publisher, and reviewer for some subset of the rest of society. The technology that enables us to work together to solve the information overload problem for each other is called collaborative filtering.",https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4471-0057-7_10
